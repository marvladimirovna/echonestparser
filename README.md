echonestparser
==============

Uses echonest API to provide additional information about songs from last.fm scrobbles.

I use last.fm scrobbler to collect all the music data, then I use IFTTT (https://ifttt.com/connect/lastfm/google_drive) to convert it to CSV.

How to use:

```bash
python songs_extractor.py <YOUR ECHO NEST API KEY>
```
